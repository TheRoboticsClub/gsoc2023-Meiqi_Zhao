Hello! My name is Meiqi "Qi" Zhao. This website is a showcase of my work for the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/). I'm incredibly thrilled to be a part of this program, where I'll be making meaningful contributions to [Behavior Metrics](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/) by JdeRobot, an open-source autonomous driving network comparison tool.

This year, my primary goal is to enhance Behavior Metrics by adding support for an obstacle avoidance task and developing an end-to-end learning solution for the task. Through the course of this project, I will be documenting my progress, challenges, learnings, and milestones on this website. Here, you will find regular updates, technical insights, as well as reflections on my GSoC journey.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Let the coding begin!
