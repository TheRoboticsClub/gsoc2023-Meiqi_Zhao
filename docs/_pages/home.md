<mark>Update 10/08/2023: </mark> **The program has successfully concluded! Check out the [recap](/gsoc2023-Meiqi_Zhao/blog/2023/week18)**

Hello! My name is Meiqi "Qi" Zhao. This website is a showcase of my work for the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/). I'm incredibly thrilled to be a part of this program, where I'll be making meaningful contributions to [Behavior Metrics](https://jderobot.github.io/BehaviorMetrics/) by JdeRobot, an open-source autonomous driving network comparison tool. I will be mentored by Sergio Paniego and Nikhil Paliwal from JdeRobot.

This year, my primary goal is to enhance Behavior Metrics by adding support for an obstacle avoidance task and developing an end-to-end learning solution for the task. Through the course of this project, I will be documenting my progress, challenges, learnings, and milestones on this website. Here, you will find regular updates, technical insights, as well as reflections on my GSoC journey. Weekly updates of the project will be posted on the [blog](/gsoc2023-Meiqi_Zhao/blog) page. For furthur details about the project, see the [roadmap](/gsoc2023-Meiqi_Zhao//roadmap) page.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:mz2651@columbia.edu) if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions. Let the coding begin!
