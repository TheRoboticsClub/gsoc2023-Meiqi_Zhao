<p>I am thrilled to be part of Google Summer of Code 2023! This week marked the official kickstart of the community bonding period at JdeRobot. My project, “Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Driving in CARLA Using Segmentation Deep Learning Models”, is poised to be a challenging yet exicting research-oriented project, which will see me delve deep into the realms of imitation learning and autonomous driving. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>This week we had our first offical meeting where we introduced ourselves and the mentors went over the logistics of the program. We also discussed the goals for this week, as listed below.</p>

<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>Before the official start of GSoC, I had already familiarized myself with the Behavior Metrics project’s codebase. My initial involvement came during the application phase, where I actively engaged with the project, contributing to its development by opening and successfully completing two GitHub issues and submitted pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics/pull/606" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#606</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics/pull/620" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#620</a>) that added obstacles to the autonomous driving task in CARLA simulator. Currently, only one dynamic obstacle is added for experimental purposes. More complex simulation senarios will be designed and implemented down the road. This prelimiary experience with the project has provided me with a strong foundation to start my GSoC journey.</p>

  <li class="task-list-item">
<input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled>Write a first blog documenting this week’s progress</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="progress">Progress</h2>

<p>This week I’ve focused on setting up this blog website. It’s crucial to have a centralized platform to document my journey and update my progress throughout the project. As suggested by the mentors, I decided to use Jekyll, a static site generator, along with GitHub Pages for hosting the website.</p>

<p><strong>To be completed</strong></p>
